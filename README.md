# Clone-All-GitHub-Repos

Python script to clone all my repos on GitHub, makes it easier on me for setting up a remote development server.

**Usage**
clone this repo
```git clone https://github.com/joeysnclr/Clone-All-GitHub-Repos.git```
run clone.py with an access token as an argument
```python3 Clone-All-GitHub-Repos/clone.py yourAccessTokenHere```

**Creating a GitHub access token**
Login to GitHub in your browser
Navigate [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
Click Generate New Token
Add a note > select the repo scope > generate token

**Info**
Repositories are cloned into the current working directory (same directory as where you run the python script).
